# 03 - useContext: simple Counter

## Background

Sharing state between components is a common problem. The best solution for this
is to 📜 [lift your state](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html). This
requires 📜 [prop drilling](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/prop-drilling) which is
not a problem, but there are some times where prop drilling can cause a real
pain.

To avoid this pain, we can insert some state into a section of our react tree,
and then extract that state anywhere within that react tree without having to
explicitly pass it everywhere. This feature is called `context`. In some ways
it's like global variables, but it doesn't suffer from the same problems (and
maintainability nightmares) of global variables thanks to how the API works to
make the relationships explicit.

`Context` also has the unique ability to be scoped to a specific section of the
React component tree. A common mistake of context (and generally any
"application" state) is to make it globally available anywhere in your
application when it's actually only needed to be available in a part of the app
(like a single page). Keeping a context value scoped to the area that needs it
most has improved performance and maintainability characteristics.

Here's how you use context:

```javascript
import React from 'react'

const FooContext = React.createContext()

function FooDisplay() {
  const foo = React.useContext(FooContext)
  return <div>Foo is: {foo}</div>
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <FooContext.Provider value="I am foo">
    <FooDisplay />
  </FooContext.Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
)
// renders <div>Foo is: I am foo</div>
```

`<FooDisplay />` could appear anywhere in the render tree, and it will have
access to the `value` which is passed by the `FooContext.Provider` component.

Note that as a first argument to `createContext`, you can provide a default
value which React will use in the event someone calls `useContext` with your
context, when no value has been provided:

```javascript
ReactDOM.render(<FooDisplay />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

Most of the time, I don't recommend using a default value because it's probably
a mistake to try and use context outside a provider, so in our exercise I'll
show you how to avoid that from happening.

## Exercise

We're putting everything in one file to keep things simple, but I've labeled
things a bit so you know that typically your context provider will be placed in
a different file and expose the provider component itself as well as the custom
hook to access the context value.

We're going to take the Count component that we had before and separate the
button from the count display. We need to access both the `count` state as well
as the `setCount` updater in these different components which live in different
parts of the tree. Normally lifting state up would be the way to solve this
trivial problem, but this is a contrived example so you can focus on learning
how to use context.

Your job is to fill in the `CountProvider` function component and `useCount`
custom hook so that the app works and the tests pass.

## Extra Credit

You do not have to do any of the extra credit, but if you finish the exercise
early then go ahead and see how far you get get into the extra credit.

### 1 - 💯 context validation

Go ahead and temporarily 🐨 update the `Usage` component to this:

```javascript
function Usage() {
  // just replace CountProvider with a div
  return (
    <div>
      <CountDisplay />
      <Counter />
    </div>
  )
}
```

You'll notice that you get an error. This is because we're trying to destructure
a context value and because no value is provided we're trying to destructure
undefined. Now 🐨 update your context to this:

```javascript
const CountContext = React.createContext({count: 0, increment: () => {}})
```

You'll notice the errors have gone away, but the app doesn't work. I don't know
about you, but I'm a fan of "fail fast and obviously" so instead of the app
looking like it's fine when it's not, we're going to make a custom error message
that makes it more obvious what's going on.

Go ahead and 🐨 undo your changes to `Usage` and `CountContext`. They should
look like this now:

```javascript
const CountContext = React.createContext()

// ...

function Usage() {
  return (
    <CountProvider>
      <CountDisplay />
      <Counter />
    </CountProvider>
  )
}
```

🐨 And update `useCount` to throw an error with a helpful message if the value
it gets from `React.useContext` is `undefined`.

> Don't forget to update the test `__tests__/03-extra.1.js` to import your
> component.

### 2 - 💯 optimized provider

Right now our provider is not optimized and a re-render of `<CountProvider />`
can trigger a re-render of every single consumer in our application whether the
`count` value has actually changed. This is because React Context checks whether
the `value` changed using `Object.is` and because we're creating the object
during rendering, it'll be different every time.

📜 You can read about this in greater detail here:
[Always useMemo your context value](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/always-use-memo-your-context-value/)

For this exercise, you need to make sure that the `value` object only changes
when the `count` state or `increment` function changes. You also only want the
`increment` function to change when the `count` changes.

Let's start with optimizing `increment` first. For this you'll need to use
`React.useCallback`. 🐨 So take the existing arrow function and pass it to
`React.useCallback(/* existing arrow function here */)`. Next, you need to tell
React when you actually need that callback to change by providing a dependencies
array similar to `useEffect`. To know the dependencies, simply look at the
variables that are used in our callback. We have only one: `setCount`. 🐨 So you
can provide that in the dependencies array (`[setCount]`). (Note, `setCount`
actually never changes, so this is basically the same as `[]`). Ok, `increment`
is now optimized.

Next let's optimize `value`. For this one we'll use React's `useMemo` hook.
`useMemo` accepts a callback which is called to retrieve the value, and it also
accepts a dependencies array. 🐨 So first, take the `value` object you have
currently and pass it as a return value for a callback you pass to `useMemo`
like so:

```js
const value = React.useMemo(() => {
  return /* the existing value object */
})
```

Next, 🐨 add a dependencies array as a second argument to `useMemo`. Our
`useMemo` callback references two variables (`count` and `increment`), so those
should both be in the dependencies array.

Great! Now you've optimized your provider. This can often be a high-value
optimization and improvement, especially when your provider has many consumers.

### 3 - 💯 configurable utilities

Ok, now let's say that we wanted to customize the `increment` function to update
the count by a step of 2 rather than 1. We could provide a `step` prop to
`CountProvider`, but let's say we want to give this flexibility to consumers so
each consumer could have their own custom `increment` `step`. We'd need to
provide an option to `useCount` and we'd need to move the `increment` helper to
the `useCount` custom hook so it can be configurable.

Go ahead and update `Counter` to look like this:

```javascript
function Counter() {
  const {increment} = useCount({step: 2})
  return <button onClick={increment}>Increment count</button>
}
```

Now you'll need to do a few things:

1. 🐨 Place `setCount` in the `CountProvider`'s `value` (note that `setCount` is
   already optimized so you don't need to worry about `useCallback` for
   `setCount`)
2. 🐨 Move `increment` to `useCount`
3. 🐨 Allow `increment` to reference the given `step`
4. 🐨 Update the `useCallback` dependencies for `increment` to include `step`

> Note, ESLint may complain at you to include `setCount` in the dependencies
> list. This is because it doesn't know that it's a pre-optimized function and
> doesn't ever change. Go ahead and include it because it wont make a difference
> anyway.

Cool! Now your consumers can configure the utilities it gets from `useCount`.

### 4 - 💯 using a reducer

Just for fun (and to prepare for the next extra credit), switch from `useState`
to `useReducer` in `CountProvider`.

> 💰 You may find it simpler to keep the reducer's state a number.

> 💰 You'll need to swap `setCount` with `dispatch` in both the `CountProvider`
> as well as `useCount`

> 💰 you'll need to allow the `action` in your `countReducer` to have a `step`
> property and use that to update the step for the `INCREMENT` action

### 5 - 💯 passing dispatch directly

So far, we've provided a utility called `increment` for people to use, but now
we're just going to give them full access to `dispatch`. This comes with the
benefit of not having to worry about `React.useCallback` for every utility and
it also encourages us to keep our state changing logic within the reducer which
has some nice maintainability benefits.

Note: I personally prefer the utility methods because I feel like they're a bit
more straightforward to consumers, but I can see value in the trade-offs of this
approach so I thought I'd show you this as well.

You'll need to do a few things:

1. 💣 Completely delete `increment` from `useCount` and instead you can simply
   `return context`.
2. 💣 Remove `{step: 2}` from the `useCount` call in `Counter`
3. 🐨 Update `Counter`'s `onClick` to an inline function which calls dispatch
   with an object that has the right `type` and `step` properties

### 6 - 💯 splitting state and dispatch into individual providers

This is an optimization that I wouldn't typically do for all context providers,
but can definitely be useful for those which are truly global and re-render
frequently.

📜 If you haven't read
[Always useMemo your context value](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/always-use-memo-your-context-value/)
yet, do so now.

We're going to implement the alternative approach by creating two contexts.
We'll render both of them in the `CountProvider`, but create a unique custom
hook for each of them.

At the end of this exercise you will have:

1. 🐨 `CountProvider` that renders both `CountStateContext.Provider` and
   `CountDispatchContext.Provider` with the proper values.
2. 🐨 `useCountState` which consumes `CountStateContext`
3. 🐨 `useCountDispatch` which consumes `CountDispatchContext`
4. 🐨 `CountDisplay` will use `useCountState`
5. 🐨 `Counter` will use `useCountDispatch`

# Real World

üë®‚Äçüíº Let's try our hand at using `useReducer` for something a little more real.
We'll be refactoring the `useState` out of our tic-tac-toe game to use
`useReducer` instead.

Your reducer should enable the following actions:

```tsx
type GameAction =
	| { type: 'SELECT_SQUARE'; index: number }
	| { type: 'SELECT_STEP'; step: number }
	| { type: 'RESTART' }

function gameReducer(state: GameState, action: GameAction) {
	// your code...
}
```

Note that to do the lazy state initialization we need to provide three arguments
to `useReducer`. Here's an example for a count reducer:

```tsx
// ...
function getInitialState(initialCount: number) {
	return { count: initialCount }
}

function Counter() {
	const [count, dispatch] = useReducer(
		countReducer,
		props.initialCount,
		getInitialState,
	)
	// ...
}
```

Notice that the `getInitialState` function is called only once, when the
component is first rendered and it's called with the `initialCount` prop which
is passed to the `useReducer` hook as the second argument.

If you don't need an argument to your initial state callback, you can just pass
`null`.

Good luck!

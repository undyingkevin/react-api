# Focus Management

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/advanced-react-apis/intro-to-focus-management" />

Helping the user's focus stay on the right place is a key part of the user
experience. This is especially important for users who rely on screen readers or
keyboard navigation. But even able users can benefit from a well-thought focus
management experience.

Sometimes, the element you want to focus on only becomes available after a state
update. For example:

```tsx
function MyComponent() {
	const [show, setShow] = useState(false)

	return (
		<div>
			<button onClick={() => setShow(true)}>Show</button>
			{show ? <input /> : null}
		</div>
	)
}
```

Presumably after the user clicks "show" they will want to type something in the
input there. Good focus management would focus the input after it becomes
visible.

It's important for you to know that in React state updates happen in batches.
So state updates do not necessarily take place at the same time you
call the state updater function.

As a result of React state update batching, if you try to focus an element right
after a state update, it might not work as expected. This is because the element
you want to focus on might not be available yet.

```tsx remove=10
function MyComponent() {
	const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null)
	const [show, setShow] = useState(false)

	return (
		<div>
			<button
				onClick={() => {
					setShow(true)
					inputRef.current?.focus() // This probably won't work
				}}
			>
				Show
			</button>
			{show ? <input ref={inputRef} /> : null}
		</div>
	)
}
```

The solution to this problem is to force React to run the state and DOM updates
synchronously so that the element you want to focus on is available when you try
to focus it.

You do this by using the `flushSync` function from the `react-dom` package.

```tsx
import { flushSync } from 'react-dom'

function MyComponent() {
	const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null)
	const [show, setShow] = useState(false)

	return (
		<div>
			<button
				onClick={() => {
					flushSync(() => {
						setShow(true)
					})
					inputRef.current?.focus()
				}}
			>
				Show
			</button>
			{show ? <input ref={inputRef} /> : null}
		</div>
	)
}
```

What `flushSync` does is that it forces React to run the state update and DOM
update synchronously. This way, the input element will be available when you try
to focus it on the line following the `flushSync` call.

In general you want to avoid this de-optimization, but in some cases (like focus
management), it's the perfect solution.

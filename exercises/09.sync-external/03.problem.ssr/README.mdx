# Handling Server Rendering

👨‍💼 We don't currently do any server rendering, but in the future we may want to
and this requires some special handling with `useSyncExternalStore`.

🧝‍♂️ I've simulated a server rendering environment by adding some code to the
bottom of our file. First, we render the `<App />` to a string, then we set that
to the `innerHTML` of our `rootEl`. Then we call `hydrateRoot` to rehydrate our
application.

👨‍💼 This is a bit of a hack, but it's a good way to simulate server rendering
and ensure that our application works in a server rendering situation.

Because the server won't know whether a media query matches, we can't use the
`getServerSnapshot()` argument of `useSyncExternalStore`. Instead, we'll leave
that argument off, and wrap our `<NarrowScreenNotifier />` in a `<Suspense />`
component with a fallback of `""` (we won't show anything until the client
hydrates).

With this, you'll notice there's an error in the console. Nothing's technically
wrong, but React logs this in this situation (I honestly personally disagree
that they should do this, but 🤷‍♂️). So as extra credit, you can add an
`onRecoverableError` function to the `hydrateRoot` call and if the given error
includes the string `'Missing getServerSnapshot'` then you can return,
otherwise, log the error.

Good luck!

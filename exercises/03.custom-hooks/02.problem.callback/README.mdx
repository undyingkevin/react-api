# useCallback

👨‍💼 We only call the `setSearchParams` function inside event handlers, so we
don't have any problems, but we're making a reusable hook and we want to make
certain people don't have problems if they need to use it in a `useEffect` or
other hook that requires a dependency array.

So I want you to wrap our `setSearchParams` function in `useCallback` to memoize
it and avoid issues with the dependency array.

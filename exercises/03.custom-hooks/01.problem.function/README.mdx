# Hook Function

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/advanced-react-apis/hook-function" />

üë®‚Äçüíº We now want to create a reusable `useSearchParams` function which will handle
the search params for us generally so we can use that logic in other components.

<callout-info>
	There's a much more complete version of this hook as a part of
	[react-router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-search-params) which
	you'll likely want to use in a real application. This is just a simple
	example.
</callout-info>

So your job is to take the logic from the `App` component that relates to the
search params and put it in a new function called `useSearchParams`, then you'll
use that function in the `App` component.

```tsx
const [searchParams, setSearchParams] = useSearchParams()
```

For the types of that tuple, you may find this article helpful:

<callout-info class="aside">
	There are actually not a lot of lines changed in this step of the exercise,
	but we're going to be bringing in `useCallback` in the next step so keep
	going!
</callout-info>

Good luck!

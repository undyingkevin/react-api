# Imperative Handles

Sometimes you need to expose a method to the parent component that allows the
parent to imperatively interact with the child component. This is done using
a `ref` which you get from the `useRef` hook. You'll recall that the `useRef`
hook allows you to have an object that's associated to a particular instance of
a component which persists across renders and doesn't trigger rerenders when
it's changed.

So a parent component can pass a `ref` to a child component and then the child
component can attach methods to that `ref` which the parent can then call:

```tsx
type InputAPI = { focusInput: () => void }

function MyInput({
	myInputRef,
	...props
}: React.InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement> & {
	myInputRef: React.RefObject<InputAPI>
}) {
	const inputRef = useRef()
	myInputRef.current = {
		focusInput: () => inputRef.current.focus(),
	}
	return <input ref={inputRef} {...props} />
}

function App() {
	const myInputRef = useRef<InputAPI>(null)
	return (
		<div>
			<MyInput myInputRef={myInputRef} placeholder="Enter your name" />
			<button onClick={() => myInputRef.current.focusInput()}>
				Focus the input
			</button>
		</div>
	)
}
```

This actually works, however there are some edge case bugs with this approach
when applied in React's concurrent/suspense features (also it doesn't support
callback refs). So instead, we'll use the `useImperativeHandle` hook to do this:

```tsx
type InputAPI = { focusInput: () => void }

function MyInput({
	myInputRef,
	...props
}: React.InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement> & {
	myInputRef: React.RefObject<InputAPI>
}) {
	const inputRef = useRef()
	useImperativeHandle(
		myInputRef,
		() => ({ focusInput: () => inputRef.current.focus() }),
		[],
	)
	return <input ref={inputRef} {...props} />
}
```

You'll notice that empty array. That's another dependency array. We don't
include the `inputRef` in there even though it's used in the function because
you actually don't need to include refs in the dependency array. Learn more
about this in
[Why you shouldn't put refs in a dependency array](https://epicreact.dev/why-you-shouldnt-put-refs-in-a-dependency-array).

`useImperativeHandle` allows us to expose imperative methods to developers who
pass a ref prop to our component which can be useful when you have something
that needs to happen and is hard to deal with declaratively.

> NOTE: most of the time you should not need `useImperativeHandle`. Before you

<callout-warning>
	The typical way to handle refs for components is to use the `React.forwardRef`
	API, however in the near future, React will remove the `React.forwardRef` API
	and instead you'll receive the `ref` as a regular prop. Until that happens, if
	you try to pass a `ref` prop without using `React.forwardRef`, you'll get an
	error. So just name it something other than `ref`.

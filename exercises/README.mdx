# Advanced React APIs 🔥

👨‍💼 Hello there! I'm Peter the Product Manager and I'll be helping guide you
through all the things that our users want to see in our app that you'll be
working on in this workshop.

We're going to cover a lot of ground and a handful of components that need to be
enhanced for the features our users are looking for. You'll be building things
using React hooks like `useReducer`, `useContext`, `useLayoutEffect`,
`useSyncExternalStore`, and more. You'll even ben building your own custom
hooks!

In addition to advanced hooks, we'll also be covering a couple advanced use
cases like focus management with `flushSync` as well as `createPortal`.

It's going to be a full experience, so let's get started!
